The file `Lab_01_Activities.Rmd` is a template for the exercises in Lab #1 to use
RMarkdown to do the following exercises from Chapter 2 in the textbook 
_Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast_.

The file contains exercises 2.1--2.7.

The answers to exercise 2.1 are given as an example of how to include
answers in RMarkdown.

The other exercises have templates for you to fill in your answers with 
R code and Markdown.

* Graduate students should answer all of the exercises. 
* Undergraduates should answer exercises 2.2, 2.4, 2.5, and 2.7.

When you are done, compile your .Rmd file into a PDF file and submit the 
completed .Rmd and .pdf files to github by the end of the day on Friday Sept. 1.

I advise using git to commit changes frequently as you work and push those commits
to github.
