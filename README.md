The file `Lab_01_Activities.Rmd` is a template for the exercises in Lab #1 to use
RMarkdown to do the following exercises from Chapter 2 in the textbook 
_Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast_.

The lab is due at 9:00 AM on Monday, Sept. 3.

The file contains exercises 2.1--2.7.

The answers to exercise 2.1 are given as an example of how to include
answers in RMarkdown.

* Graduate students should answer all of the exercises. 
* Undergraduates should answer exercises 2.2, 2.4, 2.5, and 2.7.

## Instructions:

* Clone a local copy of the file repository from github.
* In your local repository, answer the exercises in the template
  `Lab_01_Activities.Rmd`.
* When you are done, knit your `.Rmd` file into a PDF file.
* Use git to commit your changes (including the edits to `Lab_01_Activities.Rmd`
  and the new PDF file) to your local git repository.
* Push the changes from your local git repository to github.

    The last changes that you push before the due date 
    (Monday Sept. 3 at 9:00 am) will be graded.

I advise using git to commit changes frequently as you work and push those commits
to github.
