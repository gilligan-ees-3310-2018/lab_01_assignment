The File Lab_01_Activities.Rmd is a template for the exercises in Lab #1 to use
RMarkdown to do exercises from the textbook _Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast_.

The file contains exercises 2.1--2.5 and 3.1--3.3.

The answers to exercise 2.1 are given as an example of how to include
answers in RMarkdown.

The other exercises have templates for you to fill in your answers with 
R code and Markdown.

Graduate students should answer all of the exercises. Undergraduates should answer
Exercises 2.2, 2.4, 2.5, 2.7, 3.2, and 3.3.

When you are done, compile your .Rmd file into a PDF file and submit the 
completed .Rmd and .pdf files to github by the end of the day on Friday Sept. 1.

I advise using git to commit changes frequently as you work and push those commits
to github.
